/* This callback type is used inside SSL_CTX_S, SSL_S, and in the functions that set
  them. It is used to override the generation of SSL_S/TLS session IDs in a
  server. Return value should be zero on an error, non-zero to proceed. Also,
  callbacks should themselves check if the id they generate is unique otherwise
  the SSL_S handshake will fail with an error - callbacks can do this using the
  'ssl' value they're passed by;
       SSL_hasMatchingSessionID(ssl, id, *id_len)
  The length value passed in is set at the maximum size the session ID can be.
  In SSLv2 this is 16 bytes, whereas SSLv3/TLSv1 it is 32 bytes. The callback
  can alter this length to be less if desired, but under SSLv2 session IDs are
  supposed to be fixed at 16 bytes so the id will be padded after the callback
  returns in this case. It is also an error for the callback to set the size to
  zero. */

* 
* @par Description
* SSL_clear function is used to prepare an SSL object for a new connection. While all settings are kept, a side effect
* is the handling of the current SSL session. If a session is still open, it is considered bad and will be removed from
* the session cache, as required by RFC2246. A session is considered open, if SSL_shutdown was not called for the
* connection or at least SSL_setShutdown was used to set the SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN state. If a session was closed cleanly,
* the session object and all corresponding settings will be retained. For example, the special method used during the
* session will be kept for the next handshake. So if the session was a TLSv1 session, a SSL client object will use a
* TLSv1 client method for the next handshake and a SSL server object will use a TLSv1 server method, even if
* SSL_*methods were chosen on startup. This may lead to connection failures.

* settings of the last sessions (some of these settings were made automatically during the last handshake). It is 
* applicable for opening a new session (or reusing an old one) with the same peer that shares these settings.\n
* 2. SSL_clear() is not a short form for the sequence SSL_free(); SSL_new();.\n
* 3. SSL_clear function should be called only after a successful connection. It should not be called after a handshake
* is failed or during handshake is in progress.\n

* If the verification process fails, the SSL handshake is immediately terminated with an alert message containing the
* reason for the verification failure. The behavior can be controlled by the additional SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT
* flags.\n
* Client mode:The server certificate is verified. If the verification process fails, the TLS/SSL handshake is immediately
* terminated with an alert message containing the reason for the verification failure. If no server certificate is sent,
* because an anonymous cipher is used, SSL_VERIFY_PEER is ignored.\n\n
* SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT:\n
* Server mode:If the client did not return a certificate, the SSL handshake is immediately terminated with a "handshake

* occurred or the connection was shut down cleanly (SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN).\n
* SSLv2 (deprecated) does not support a shutdown alert protocol, so it can only be detected whether the underlying

* [Zero|N/A]
* @retval SEC_INT The read operation was not successful, because either an error occurred or an action must be taken

*
* @par Note

* 1. If necessary, SSL_read() will negotiate a TLS/SSL session, if not already explicitly performed by SSL_connect() or
*    SSL_accept(). If the peer requests a re-negotiation, it will be performed transparently during the SSL_read()
*    operation. The behavior of SSL_read() depends on the underlying sockstream.\n\n
* 2. For the transparent negotiation to succeed, the ssl must have been initialized to client or server mode. This is
*    being done by calling SSL_setConnectState() or SSL_setAcceptState() before the first call to an SSL_read() or
*    SSL_write() function.\n\n
* 3. SSL_read() works based on the SSL/TLS records. The data are received in records (with a maximum record size of 16kB
*    for SSLv3/TLSv1). Only when a record has been completely received, it can be processed (decryption and check of
*    integrity). Therefore data that was not retrieved at the last call of SSL_read() can still be buffered inside the
*    SSL layer and will be retrieved on the next call to SSL_read(). If iNum is higher than the number of bytes buffered,
*    SSL_read() will return with the bytes buffered. If no more bytes are in the buffer, SSL_read() will trigger the
*    processing of the next record. Only when the record has been received and processed completely, SSL_read() will
*    return reporting success. At most the contents of the record will be returned. As the size of an SSL/TLS record may
*    exceed the maximum packet size of the underlying transport (e.g. TCP), it may be necessary to read several packets
*    from the transport layer before the record is complete and SSL_read() can succeed.\n\n
* 4. If the underlying socket is blocking, SSL_read() will only return, once the read operation has been finished or an
*    error occurred, except when a renegotiation takes place, in which case a SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ may occur. This
*    behavior can be controlled with the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag of the SSL_CTX_SET_MODE() macro call.\n\n
* 5. If the underlying socket is non-blocking, SSL_read() will also return when the underlying socket could not satisfy
*    the needs of SSL_read() to continue the operation. In this case a call to SSL_getError() with the return value of
*    SSL_read() will yield SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ or SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE. As at any time a re-negotiation is possible, a
*    call to SSL_read() can also cause write operations. The calling process then must repeat the call after taking
*    appropriate action to satisfy the needs of SSL_read(). The action depends on the underlying socket. When using a
*    non-blocking socket, nothing is to be done, but select() can be used to check for the required condition.
* 6. Renegotiation requested by peer can be rejected and send fatal handshake failure or no renegotiation warning alert
*    to peer side by enabling SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_FATAL or SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_WARN option. At this case
*    return value will be SEC_ERROR. If warning alert is send, then the connection can be continued if peer side

*		- Baglist - List of bags
*		- Authsafe - List of Baglists
		- PFX - Encoded authsafe
*		- Mac password - Used for integrity check on the encoded data

* for rejecting renegotiation with fatal or warning alert. Any other value returns from this callback will be considered
* as SEC_SUCCESS only. But its strongly recommended to implement this callback by returning any of these 3 values
* because in future we will be expanding the usage of this callback function for some other feature also.\n
* 2. ACESSL doesn`t supports  SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_WARN, so if this callback function returns
* SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_WARN in ACESSL, then it treats this as SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_FATAL only.\n
* 3. SSLv3 RFC mandates to send only fatal alert for rejecting renegotiation. So if negotiated version is SSLv3 and 
* callback returns SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_WARN then renegotiation will be rejected with fatal alert. But
* other versions (TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2) can send both warning and fatal alert. \n
* 4. SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_FATAL and SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_WARN can be set as control behaviour options also using
* SSL_SET_BEHAVIOUR_OPTIONS or SSL_CTX_SET_BEHAVIOUR_OPTIONS. If both control behaviour option and this callback are
* set then only callback will be considered, control behaviour option will not be considered.\n

* @par Note
* 1. IPSI_SSL_RENEG_MANAG_CB - This callback function has to return SEC_SUCCESS if user wants to allow the 
* renegotiation. Or else it has to return SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_FATAL or SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_WARN
* for rejecting renegotiation with fatal or warning alert. Any other value returns from this callback will be considered
* as SEC_SUCCESS only. But its strongly recommended to implement this callback by returning any of these 3 values
* because in future we will be expanding the usage of this callback function for some other feature also.\n
* 2. ACESSL doesn`t supports  SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_WARN, so if this callback function returns
* SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_WARN in ACESSL, then it treats this as SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_FATAL only.\n
* 3. SSLv3 RFC mandates to send only fatal alert for rejecting renegotiation. So if negotiated version is SSLv3 and 
* callback returns SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_WARN then renegotiation will be rejected with fatal alert. But
* other versions (TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2) can send both warning and fatal alert. \n
* 4. SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_FATAL and SSL_CTRL_BEHAV_NORENEG_WARN can be set as control behaviour options also using
* SSL_SET_BEHAVIOUR_OPTIONS or SSL_CTX_SET_BEHAVIOUR_OPTIONS. If both control behaviour option and this callback are
* set then only callback will be considered, control behaviour option will not be considered.\n
